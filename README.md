# Senior-Project---EE416: Leak Detection System for the Robosub Autonomous Submarine
Ensuring the protection of electronics is an integral portion of any electromechanical system. Our project goal is to protect electronics within the hull of the WSU Robosub Clubâ€™s autonomous submarine, by implementing methods of leak detection. Providing information of an onboard leak allows for preventative action, and could potentiallysave thousands of dollars worth of material onboard. We have developed a two-part procedure to check, and monitor for potential leaks. This procedure consists of testing for leaks before the submarine is submerged, and is followed by an internal system that monitors water infiltration while underway. This project has met the needs and requirements set by our clients and stakeholders, while maintaining freedom of engineering design interpretation.<br /><br />
The DS_LC234X is FTDI - USB connector and we will use atmega1284P-AU chip for the project. <br />
EE415 code: Code to test the leak before submarine is submerged. <br />
EE416 code: Code for the internal(onboard) system. <br />  
Aruino Nano Shield: is our back up plan in case the internal system is fail.
